# Welcome to NitroXpress

You are using the most robust and concise express.js server starter kit. All of the things are covered via Gulp 4. _(P.S. I'm a Big fan of Gulp)_

Just run npm i then gulp dev and you will have a server running

It have the following preconfigured libraries and tools:

1. Server Stack
   1. TypeScript
   2. Express.js (with all required utitilties)
   3. MongoDB
   4. Mongoose - ORM
2. Build System - Tools
   1. Gulp 4
   2. Webpack - for client side bundling
   3. Sass
   4. PM2
   5. browser-sync â€“ for auto reloading even when the server code is changed

## How to Install from Server

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NitroxisInc/nitroXpress.git PROJECTNAME
cd PROJECTNAME
npm install
#  or
yarn install
```

## Development server
